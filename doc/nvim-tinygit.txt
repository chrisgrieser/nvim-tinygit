A lightweight bundle of commands focused on swift and streamlined git
operations.




FEATURE OVERVIEW                  *nvim-tinygit-nvim-tinygit-feature-overview*

- **Interactive staging** of hunks (parts of a file). Displays hunk diffs with
    proper syntax highlighting, and allows resetting or navigating to the hunk.
- **Smart-commit**Open a popup to enter a commit message with syntax highlighting,
    commit preview, automatic issue number insertion, and overlength indicators.
    If there are no staged changes, stages all changes before doing so (`git add   -A`). Optionally trigger a `git push` afterward.
- Quick commands for amend, stash, fixup, or undoing commits.
- Search **issues & PRs**. Open the selected issue or PR in the browser.
- Open the **GitHub URL** of the current file, repo, or selection. Also supports
    opening the blame view.
- **Explore the git history**Search the file for a string ("git pickaxe"), or
    examine the history of a function or line range. Displays the results in a
    diff view with syntax highlighting, correctly following file renamings.
- **Status line components:** `git blame` of a file and branch state.
- **Streamlined workflow:** operations are smartly combined to minimize
    friction. For instance, the smart-commit command combines staging, committing,
    and pushing, and searching the file history combines un-shallowing, searching,
    and navigating diffs.

INSTALLATION                          *nvim-tinygit-nvim-tinygit-installation*

**Hard requirements** - nvim 0.10+ - `dressing.nvim`

**Optional/recommended requirements** - Treesitter parser for syntax
highlighting: `TSInstall gitcommit` - nvim-notify
<http://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-notify> OR snacks.nvim
<http://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim> for the commit preview, issue number
insertion, and various notifications. - telescope.nvim
<https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim> OR fzf-lua
<https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua> for nicer UI when selecting commits,
issues, or PRs. - telescope.nvim
<https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim> is required for interactive
staging. - GitHub-related features require `curl`.

>lua
    -- lazy.nvim
    {
        "chrisgrieser/nvim-tinygit",
        dependencies = "stevearc/dressing.nvim",
    },
    
    -- packer
    use {
        "chrisgrieser/nvim-tinygit",
        requires = "stevearc/dressing.nvim",
    }

COMMANDS                                  *nvim-tinygit-nvim-tinygit-commands*

All commands are available via lua function or sub-command of `:Tinygit`, for
example `require("tinygit").interactiveStaging()` and `:Tinygit
interactiveStaging`. However, do note that the lua function is preferable,
since the `:Tinygit` does not accept command-specific options and also does not
trigger visual-mode specific changes to the commands.


INTERACTIVE STAGING ~

- This feature requires
    telescope.nvim <https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim>.
- This command stages hunks, that is, _parts_ of a file instead of the
    full file. It is roughly comparable to `git add -p`.
- Use `<Space>` to (un)stage the hunk, `<CR>` to go to the hunk, or `<C-r` to
    reset the hunk (mappings customizable). Your regular `telescope` mappings also
    apply.
- The size of the hunks is determined by the setting `staging.contextSize`.
    Larger context size is going to "merge" changes that are close to one another
    into one hunk. (As such, the hunks displayed are not 1:1 the same as the hunks
    from `gitsigns.nvim`.) A context size between 1 and 4 is recommended.
- Limitations: `contextSize=0` (= no merging at all) is not supported.

>lua
    require("tinygit").interactiveStaging()
<


SMART-COMMIT ~

- Open a commit popup, alongside a preview of what is going to be committed. If
    there are no staged changes, stage all changes (`git add --all`) before the
    commit.
- Input field contents of aborted commits are briefly kept, if you just want to
    fix a detail.
- Optionally run `git push` if the repo is clean after committing.
- The title of the input field displays what actions are going to be performed.
    You can see at glance whether all changes are going to be committed, or whether
    there a `git push` is triggered afterward, so there are no surprises.
- Typing `#` inserts the most recent issue number, `<Tab>` cycles through the
    issues (opt-in, see plugin configuration).
- Only supports the commit subject line (no commit body).

>lua
    -- values shown are the defaults
    require("tinygit").smartCommit { pushIfClean = false, pullBeforePush = true }
<

**Example workflow** Assuming these keybindings:

>lua
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>ga", function() require("tinygit").interactiveStaging() end, { desc = "git add" })
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>gc", function() require("tinygit").smartCommit() end, { desc = "git commit" })
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>gp", function() require("tinygit").push() end, { desc = "git push" })
<

1. Stage some changes via `ga`.
2. Use `gc` to enter a commit message.
3. Repeat 1 and 2.
4. When done, `gp` to push the commits.

Using `pushIfClean = true` allows you to combine staging, committing, and
pushing into a single step, when it is the last commit you intend to make.


AMEND AND FIXUP COMMITS ~

**Amending** - `amendOnlyMsg` just opens the commit popup to change the last
commit message, and does not stage any changes. - `amendNoEdit` keeps the last
commit message; if there are no staged changes, stages all changes (`git add
--all`), like `smartCommit`. - Optionally runs `git push --force-with-lease`
afterward, if the branch has diverged (that is, the amended commit was already
pushed).

>lua
    -- options default to `false`
    require("tinygit").amendOnlyMsg { forcePushIfDiverged = false }
    require("tinygit").amendNoEdit { forcePushIfDiverged = false, stageAllIfNothingStaged = true }
<

**Fixup commits** - `fixupCommit` lets you select a commit from the last X
commits and runs `git commit --fixup` on the selected commit. - If there are no
staged changes, stages all changes (`git add --all`), like `smartCommit`. -
`autoRebase = true` automatically runs rebase with `--autosquash` and
`--autostash` afterward, confirming all fixups and squashes **without opening a
rebase to do editor**. Note that this can potentially result in conflicts.

>lua
    -- options show default values
    require("tinygit").fixupCommit {
        selectFromLastXCommits = 15,
        autoRebase = false,
    }
<


UNDO LAST COMMIT/AMEND ~

>lua
    require("tinygit").undoLastCommitOrAmend()
<

- Changes in the working directory are kept, but unstaged. (In the background,
    this uses `git reset --mixed`.)
- If there was a `push` operation done as a followup (such as `.smartCommit {   pushIfClean = false }`), the last commit is not undone.


GITHUB INTERACTION ~

**Search issues & PRs** - Requires `curl`.

>lua
    -- state: all|closed|open (default: all)
    -- type: all|issue|pr (default: all)
    require("tinygit").issuesAndPrs { type = "all", state = "all" }
    
    -- alternative: if the word under the cursor is of the form `#123`,
    -- open that issue/PR
    require("tinygit").openIssueUnderCursor()
<

**GitHub URL** Creates a permalink to the current file/lines at GitHub. The
link is opened in the browser and copied to the system clipboard. In normal
mode, uses the current file, in visual mode, uses the selected lines. (Note
that visual mode detection requires you to use the lua function below instead
of the `:Tinygit` ex-command.) - `"file"`code view - `"blame"`blame view -
`"repo"`repo root

>lua
    -- file|repo|blame (default: file)
    require("tinygit").githubUrl()
<


PUSH & PRS ~

- `push` can be combined with other actions, depending on the options.
- `createGitHubPr` opens a PR from the current branch browser. (This requires the
    repo to be a fork with sufficient information on the remote.)

>lua
    -- options default to `false`
    require("tinygit").push {
        pullBefore = false,
        forceWithLease = false,
        createGitHubPr = false,
    }
    require("tinygit").createGitHubPr()
<


SEARCH FILE HISTORY ~

Search the git history of the current file. Select from the matching commits to
open a popup with a diffview of the changes.

If the config `history.autoUnshallowIfNeeded` is set to `true`, will also
automatically un-shallow the repo if needed.

>lua
    require("tinygit").fileHistory()
<

The type of history search depends on the mode `.searchHistory` is called from:
- **Normal mode**search history for a string (`git log -G`) Correctly follows
file renamings, and displays past file names in the commit selection. The
search input is case-insensitive and supports regex. Leave the input field
empty to display _all_ commits that changed the current file. - **Visual
mode**function history (`git log -L`). The selected text is assumed to be the
name of the function whose history you want to explore. Note that `git` uses
heuristics to determine the enclosing function of a change
<https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38153309>, so this is not 100% perfect
and has varying reliability across languages. Caveat: for function history, git
does not support to follow renamings of the file or function name. - **Visual
line mode**line range history (`git log -L`). Uses the selected lines as the
line range. Caveat: for line history, git does not support to follow file
renamings.

Note that visual mode detection requires you to use the lua function above
instead of the `:Tinygit` ex-command.

**Keymaps in the diff popup** - `<Tab>`show older commit - `<S-Tab>`show newer
commit - `yh`yank the commit hash to the system clipboard - `R`restore file to
state at commit - `n`/`N`go to the next/previous occurrence of the query (only
file history)


STASH ~

Simple wrappers around `git stash push` and `git stash pop`.

>lua
    require("tinygit").stashPush()
    require("tinygit").stashPop()
<


STATUS LINE COMPONENTS      *nvim-tinygit-nvim-tinygit-status-line-components*


GIT BLAME ~

Shows the message and date (`git blame`) of the last commit that changed the
current _file_ (not line).

>lua
    require("tinygit.statusline").blame()
<


  [!TIP] Some status line plugins also allow you to put components into the tab
  line or win bar. If your status line is too crowded, you can add the
  blame-component to one of those bars instead.
The component can be configured with the `statusline.blame` options in the
|nvim-tinygit-plugin-configuration|.


BRANCH STATE ~

Shows whether the local branch is ahead or behind of its remote counterpart.
(Note that this component does not run `git fetch` for performance reasons, so
the information may not be up-to-date with remote changes.)

>lua
    require("tinygit.statusline").branchState()
<


CONFIGURATION                        *nvim-tinygit-nvim-tinygit-configuration*

The `setup` call is optional.


  [!NOTE] Recently (2024-11-23), the config structure has been overhauled: -
  `staging` → `stage` - `commitMsg` → `commit` `commitMsg.commitPreview` →
  `commit.preview` `commitMsg.insertIssuesOnHash` →
  `commit.insertIssuesOnHashSign` - `historySearch` → `history` - `issueIcons`
  → `github.icons` - `backdrop` → `appearance.backdrop` - `mainIcon` →
  `appearance.mainIcon`
