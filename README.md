## Feature Overview
- **Interactive Staging** of hunks (parts of a file). Displays hunk diffs with
  proper syntax highlighting, and allows resetting or navigating to the hunk.
- **Smart-Commit**: Open a popup to enter a commit message with syntax highlighting,
  commit preview, automatic issue number insertion, and overlength indicators.
  If there are no staged changes, stages all changes before doing so (`git add
  -A`). Optionally trigger a `git push` afterward.
- Quick commands for amend, stash, fixup, or undoing commits.
- Search **issues & PRs**. Open the selected issue or PR in the browser.
- Open the **GitHub URL** of the current line or selection.
- **Explore the git history**: Search the file for a string ("git pickaxe"), or
  examine a function's or line's history. Displays the results in a diff view
  with syntax highlighting, correctly following file renamings.
- **Statusline components:** `git blame` of a file and branch state.
- **Streamlined workflow:** operations are smartly combined to minimize
  friction. For instance, the smart-commit command combines staging, committing,
  and pushing, and searching the file history combines unshallowing, searching,
  and navigating diffs.

## Installation
**Hard Requirements**  
- nvim 0.10 or higher
- `dressing.nvim`

**Optional/Recommended Requirements**
- Treesitter parser for syntax highlighting: `TSInstall gitcommit`
- `nvim-notify` for the commit preview, issue number insertion, and various
  notifications
- [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) or
  [fzf-lua](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua) for better UI when selecting
  commits or issues/PRs.
- `telescope` is required for interactive staging.

```lua
-- lazy.nvim
{
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-tinygit",
	dependencies = {
		"stevearc/dressing.nvim",
		"nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim", -- optional, but recommended
		"rcarriga/nvim-notify", -- optional, but recommended
	},
},

-- packer
use {
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-tinygit",
	requires = {
		"stevearc/dressing.nvim", 
		"nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim", -- optional, but recommended
		"rcarriga/nvim-notify", -- optional, but recommended
	},
}
```

## Commands

### Interactive Staging
- This feature requires
  [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim).
- This command stages hunks, that is, *parts* of a file instead of the
  full file. It is roughly comparable to `git add -p`.
- Use `<Space>` to (un)stage the hunk, `<CR>` to go to the hunk, or `<C-r` to
  reset the hunk (mappings customizable). Your regular `telescope` mappings also
  apply. Staging and resets support Telescope multi selections.
- The size of the hunks is determined by the setting `staging.contextSize`.
  Larger context size is going to "merge" changes that are close to one another
  into one hunk. (As such, the hunks displayed are not 1:1 the same as the hunks
  from `gitsigns.nvim`.) A context size between 1 and 4 is recommended.
- Limitations: `contextSize=0` (= no merging at all) is currently not supported.

```lua
require("tinygit").interactiveStaging()
```

### Smart-Commit
- Open a commit popup, alongside a preview of what is going to be committed. If
  there are no staged changes, stage all changes (`git add --all`) before the
  commit.
- Input field contents of aborted commits are briefly kept, if you just want to
  fix a detail.
- Optionally run `git push` if the repo is clean after committing.
- The title of the input field displays what actions are going to be performed.
  You can see at glance whether all changes are going to be committed, or whether
  there a `git push` is triggered afterward, so there are no surprises.
- Typing `#` inserts the most recent issue number, `<Tab>` cycles through the
  issues (currently opt-in, see plugin configuration).
- Only supports the commit subject line (no commit body).

```lua
-- values shown are the defaults
require("tinygit").smartCommit { pushIfClean = false, pullBeforePush = true }
```

**Example Workflow**
Assuming these keybindings:

```lua
vim.keymap.set("n", "ga", "<cmd>Gitsigns add_hunk<CR>") -- gitsigns.nvim
vim.keymap.set("n", "gc", function() require("tinygit").smartCommit() end)
vim.keymap.set("n", "gp", function() require("tinygit").push() end)
```

1. Stage some hunks (changes) via `ga`.
2. Use `gc` to enter a commit message.
3. Repeat 1 and 2.
4. When done, `gp` to push the commits.

Using `pushIfClean = true` allows you to combine staging, committing, and
pushing into a single step, when it is the last commit you intend to make.

### Amend, Fixup, and Squash Commits
**Amending**
- `amendOnlyMsg` just opens the commit popup to change the last commit message,
  and does not stage any changes.
- `amendNoEdit` keeps the last commit message; if there are no staged changes,
  stages all changes (`git add --all`), like `smartCommit`.
- Optionally runs `git push --force-with-lease` afterward, if the branch has
  diverged (that is, the amended commit was already pushed).

```lua
-- options default to `false`
require("tinygit").amendOnlyMsg { forcePushIfDiverged = false }
require("tinygit").amendNoEdit { forcePushIfDiverged = false }
```

**Fixup and Squash**
- `fixupCommit` lets you select a commit from the last X commits and runs `git
  commit --fixup` on the selected commit.
- If there are no staged changes, stages all changes (`git add --all`), like
  `smartCommit`.
- Use `squashInstead = true` to squash instead of fixup (`git commit --squash`).
- `autoRebase = true` automatically runs rebase with `--autosquash` and
`--autostash` afterward, confirming all fixups and squashes **without opening a
rebase view**. (Note that this can potentially result in conflicts.)

```lua
-- options show default values
require("tinygit").fixupCommit {
	selectFromLastXCommits = 15,
	squashInstead = false,
	autoRebase = false,
}
```

### Undo Last Commit/Amend

```lua
require("tinygit").undoLastCommitOrAmend()
```

- Changes in the working directory are kept, but unstaged. (In the background,
  this uses `git reset --mixed`.)
- If there was a `push` operation done as a followup (such as `.smartCommit {
  pushIfClean = false }`), the last commit is not undone.

### GitHub Interaction
- Search issues & PRs.
- Requires `curl`.

```lua
-- state: all|closed|open (default: all)
-- type: all|issue|pr (default: all)
require("tinygit").issuesAndPrs { type = "all", state = "all" }

-- alternative: if the word under the cursor is of the form `#123`,
-- just open that issue/PR
require("tinygit").openIssueUnderCursor()
```

- Open the current file at GitHub in the browser and copy the URL to the system clipboard.
- Normal mode: open the current file or repo.
- Visual mode: open the current selection.

```lua
-- file|repo (default: file)
require("tinygit").githubUrl("file")
```

### Push & PR
- `push` can be combined with other actions, depending on the options.
- `createGitHubPr` opens a PR from the current branch browser.
	* This requires the repo to be a fork with sufficient information on the remote.
	* This does not require the `gh` cli, as it uses a GitHub web feature.

```lua
-- options default to `false`
require("tinygit").push {
	pullBefore = false,
	forceWithLease = false,
	createGitHubPr = false,
}
require("tinygit").createGitHubPr()
```

### Explore the History of a File, Function, or Line ("git pickaxe")
Search the git history. Select from the matching commits to open a popup with a
diffview of the changes.

- Search the git **history of the current file** (`git log -G`).
	* The search is case-insensitive and supports regex.
	* Correctly follows file renamings, and displays past file names in the commit
	  selection.
	* Leave the input field empty to display *all* commits that changed the
	  current file.
- Explore the **history of a function in the current file** (`git log -L`).
	* The search is literal.
	* If the current buffer has an LSP with support for document symbols
	  attached, you can select a function. (Otherwise, you are prompted to
	  enter a function name.)
	* Note that [`git` uses heuristics to determine the enclosing function of a
	  change](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38153309), so this is not
	  100% perfect and has varying reliability across languages.
- Go through the **history of the current line (range)** (`git log -L`).
	* In normal mode, searches the history of the line under the cursor.
	* When called in visual mode, searches the history of the selected line
	  range.

**Keymaps in the diff popup**
- `<Tab>`: show older commit
- `<S-Tab>`: show newer commit
- `yh`: yank the commit hash to the system clipboard
- `R`: restore file to state at commit
- `n`/`N`: go to the next/previous occurrence of the query (only file history)

```lua
require("tinygit").searchFileHistory()
require("tinygit").functionHistory()
require("tinygit").lineHistory()
```

### Stash
Simple wrappers around `git stash push` and `git stash pop`.

```lua
require("tinygit").stashPush()
require("tinygit").stashPop()
```

## Statusline Components

### Git Blame
Shows the message and date (`git blame`) of the last commit that changed the
current *file* (not line).

```lua
require("tinygit.statusline").blame()
```

> [!TIP]
> Some status line plugins also allow you to put components into the tabline or
> winbar. If your status line is too crowded, you can add the blame-component to
> the one of those bars instead.

The component can be configured with the `statusline.blame` options in the [plugin
configuration](#configuration).

### Branch State
Shows whether the local branch is ahead or behind of its remote counterpart.
(Note that this component does not run `git fetch` for performance reasons, so
the information may not be up-to-date with remote changes.)

```lua
require("tinygit.statusline").branchState()
```

## Configuration
The `setup` call is optional. These are the default settings:

```lua
-- default config
require("tinygit").setup({
	staging = { -- requires telescope
		contextSize = 1, -- larger values "merge" hunks
		stagedIndicator = "✜ ",
		keymaps = { -- insert & normal mode
			stagingToggle = "<Space>", -- stage/unstage hunk
			gotoHunk = "<CR>",
			resetHunk = "<C-r>",
		},
	},
	commitMsg = {
		commitPreview = true, -- requires nvim-notify
		spellcheck = false,
		keepAbortedMsgSecs = 300,
		inputFieldWidth = 72, -- `false` to use dressing.nvim config
		conventionalCommits = {
			enforce = false,
			-- stylua: ignore
			keywords = {
				"fix", "feat", "chore", "docs", "refactor", "build", "test",
				"perf", "style", "revert", "ci", "break", "improv",
			},
		},
		openReferencedIssue = false, -- if message has issue/PR, open in browser afterwards
		insertIssuesOnHash = {
			-- Experimental. Typing `#` will insert the most recent open issue.
			-- Requires nvim-notify.
			enabled = false,
			next = "<Tab>", -- insert & normal mode
			prev = "<S-Tab>",
			issuesToFetch = 20,
		},
	},
	push = {
		preventPushingFixupOrSquashCommits = true,
		confirmationSound = true, -- currently macOS only, PRs welcome
	},
	historySearch = {
		diffPopup = {
			width = 0.8, -- float, 0 to 1
			height = 0.8,
			border = "single",
		},
		autoUnshallowIfNeeded = false,
	},
	issueIcons = {
		openIssue = "🟢",
		closedIssue = "🟣",
		notPlannedIssue = "⚪",
		openPR = "🟩",
		mergedPR = "🟪",
		draftPR = "⬜",
		closedPR = "🟥",
	},
	statusline = {
		blame = {
			ignoreAuthors = {}, -- hide component if these authors (useful for bots)
			hideAuthorNames = {}, -- show component, but hide names (useful for your own name)
			maxMsgLen = 40,
			icon = "ﰖ ",
		},
		branchState = {
			icons = {
				ahead = "󰶣",
				behind = "󰶡",
				diverge = "󰃻",
			},
		},
	},
	backdrop = {
		enabled = true,
		blend = 50, -- 0-100
	},
})
```

The appearance of the commit preview and notifications is determined by
[nvim-notify](https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-notify). To change for example
the width of the preview, use:

```lua
require("notify").setup {
	max_width = 60,
}
```
